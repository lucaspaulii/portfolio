                <p>Hi! I’m Lucas, a building technician with an uncompleted civil engineering bachelor who left the career in construction for an adventure at the tech industry, with the goal of becoming an estabilished software developer.<br>
                As many teenagers, when I found out that I had a logical brain and that I was really good at math, teachers and relatives began advising me to seek a career in engineering. At 14 I took my first admission exam to enter IFSC (federal institute of Santa Catarina) in the high school / building technician hybrid course, and was approved at the first try. After I finished the course the clear path to me was taking the Civil Engineering admission exam at UFSC (feredal university of Santa Catarina) and so I did, and was approved at the first try one more time.<br>
                Some years later, after four internships in different areas of construction and lots of classes, it was clear to me that this path was way off my actual vocation, and that I needed to seek a different career sooner rather than later. At this time I stumbled on some YouTube advertisements about programming and developping softwares and instantly fell in love with it. After some research I started the Full-Stack Career Path course on CodeCademy and this is the point where we are right now.
                <br>In my free time I like to play the guitar, write songs, play soccer and handball, and play videogames. People usually describe me as an outgoing friendly person, with a really good logic/creative brain.
                </p>
